## :technologist: About me

My name is Daniel Kulichkov. I am **Software Developer**. I got a position as a **lead** developer in [Background Digital](https://background.digital).
The main direction of my activity now is the Web Development. In general, I specialize in [Angular](https://angular.io), but I can also effectively
use other frameworks or libraries. Such as [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

I like **C++** and **C#**, so I learn Unity Game Development too. I can say it is very interesting (as hard) and exciting to build your own worlds.

#### :question: What do I want to learn in the future?

I'm looking towards **design**. I think that any developer should know at least a little about design. This is not to mention web development.
Although the Angular specification rather refers to the creation of control tools (administrative panels), and not ordinary web pages, as it seems to me.

Also, I wanna learn **iOS development** (send me macbook plz). I am very inspired by iOS application. They are structured, which I find attractive.

## :notebook: Little about my projects

### [Kulichkoff's ERP](https://github.com/kulichkoff/kulichkoff-erp)

<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/kulichkoff/kulichkoff-erp" />

Very little ERP system for my father's business. It is a very specific project. The main task of it is generating bills for counter agents.

Kulichkoff's ERP is a good project for me to show my hard skills using Angular. In this project I experimented with docker-compose contexts
and with **Nx**.
