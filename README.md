## :technologist: About me

My name is Daniel Kulichkov. I am a **Software Developer** in [First Line Outsourcing](https://www.flo.team/ru/).
The main direction of my activity now is the Web Development with cloud technologies such as AWS Serverless.

I like **C++** and **C#**, so I learn Unity Game Development too. I can say it is very interesting (as hard) and exciting to build your own worlds.

## :notebook: Little about my projects

### [Kulichkoff's ERP](https://github.com/kulichkoff/kulichkoff-erp)

<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/kulichkoff/kulichkoff-erp" />

Very little ERP system for my father's business. It is a very specific project. The main task of it is generating bills for counter agents.

Kulichkoff's ERP is a good project for me to show my hard skills using Angular and Nest JS frameworkds. 
In this project I experimented with docker-compose contexts and with **Nx**.
